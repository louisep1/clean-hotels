error in backend if body/param data missing from frontend

- (at some point fix ability to adjust number of guests / rooms based on how many guests, etc...)
- (number of rooms isn't saved in the backend in booking table, but room_id is so it is implicit)
- => could therefore maybe set a max number of rooms per booking (e.g. room_id_1, room_id_2, room_id_2) (max 3 rooms/booking)




========================================
fixed but with MINOR SIDE-useEffect

=> now when you refresh the page, it redirects you off 
=> but often redirects twice so you end up on home page or other page (not intended reservations page => but this is ok as it still prevents the user from double booking a room)

- page refresh after entering email and submitting on booking page anables you to book again? check and stop that from happening => maybe fixed with this:

useEffect(() => {
    window.onbeforeunload = () => {
      navigate('/reservation')
    };
  }, [])

Fixed: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_element_getboundingclientrect.asp
- when you click the image slider with touchpage, doesn't work because it reads it as a swipe
