1.) the backend currently fetches data for only one date, not the full range of database
need to somehow refine for a particular room that matches all the dates requested



BIG PROBLEMS:
the database loses connection/times out after a few seconds of inactivity

after inactivity, cannot proxy to the server (database not connected) => 500 internal server error
