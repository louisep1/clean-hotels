- font sizes in mobile (including the facilities section on home)


- (at some point fix ability to adjust number of guests / rooms based on how many guests, etc...)



- ?? SOMETIMES results title shows on reservation page before search is sent => not sure why...






========================================
maybe fixed:

- page refresh after entering email and submitting on booking page anables you to book again? check and stop that from happening => maybe fixed with this:
useEffect(() => {
    window.onbeforeunload = () => {
      navigate('/reservation')
    };
  }, [])

- when you click the image slider with touchpage, doesn't work because it reads it as a swipe
