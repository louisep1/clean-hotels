Rewrite the backend because syntax doesn't seem to work (keeps erroring)



BIG PROBLEMS:
the database loses connection/times out after a few seconds of inactivity

after inactivity, cannot proxy to the server (database not connected) => 500 internal server error

- when you click the image slider with touchpage, doesn't work because it reads it as a swipe
