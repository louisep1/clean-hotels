if using command
cd backend
nodemon server.js

then it seems .env needs to be in the same folder as the server.js

!!!! BUT

if using the package.json scripts to use nodemon
e.g.
"start": "node backend/server.js",
"server": "nodemon backend/server.js",

then .env needs to be in the root directory (or maybe just with the package.json ?)
(BUT it still sometimes fails though and crashes.....)
